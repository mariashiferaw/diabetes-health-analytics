- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Main Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and recoding variables
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, distributions)
- Visualizations of key patterns and relationships

## Files
- `Phase3_Preprocessing.ipynb` – data cleaning and feature preparation
- `Descriptive_Analysis.ipynb` – summary statistics and visualizations

## Key Insights
- Identified associations between diabetes status and variables such as income, education, and BMI.
- Highlighted groups with higher healthcare expenditures and potential risk factors.
